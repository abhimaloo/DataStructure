Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Example:

Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).

Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

    /*
    Given numbers [2, 3, 4, 5], regarding the third number 4, the product of array except 4 is 2*3*5 which consists of two parts: left 2*3 and right 5. The product is left*right. We can get lefts and rights:

Numbers:     2    3    4     5
Lefts:            2  2*3 2*3*4
Rights:  3*4*5  4*5    5
Letâ€™s fill the empty with 1:

Numbers:     2    3    4     5
Lefts:       1    2  2*3 2*3*4
Rights:  3*4*5  4*5    5     1
We can calculate lefts and rights in 2 loops. The time complexity is O(n).
